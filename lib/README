Open questions:

* When we're in secondary state, do we send telemetry up to the primary or to the secondary?
  * By sending tele only over secondary, now the TX side mux knows when the RX side mux has changed states
  * In all cases, the TX side forwards basic TELE frames from both links into the handset???
  * Filter mixer sync though & MSP & etc.
